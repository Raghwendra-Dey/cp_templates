# cp_templates
This repo contains all the templates used by me for cp <br>
`cp.xml` or `cp.cpp` contains the template used in problems without test cases thing.<br>
`chf.xml` or `chf.cpp` is for problems with test cases thing.
`gc.xml` or `gc.cpp` is template for google competitions which usually requires the output in the format of `Case #NO: ANS`.
